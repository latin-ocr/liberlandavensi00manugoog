Sacr. Ι. arra or su. rnrno. 353

On the night of his deoease, there arose a great disputa
between the elergy 01 three of his churches, each asserting
its authorities and privileges for obtaining his body; one,
of which was Pennalun,1 aud which claimed because it
was thera his aneestors had been buried, aud therefore,
the proper place by hereditary right3 the second church,¹
which was situated on the banks of the Towy, claimed it
because it was the place of ,his residence, where he lived
retired, and because he there gloriously ended his life3 the
third was Llaudali, and urged its claim on account of its
having been his episcopal see, of its privileges aud dignities,
its consecrations and obediente, and of the unanimous voice
of all the diocese, aud especially because of its former state,
and the appointment 01 St. Dubricius, and other fathers
But at length attending to the advice 01 disereet men, they
had reeourse to fasting aud prayer, that Christ, the great
judge, who is the true authority, and privilege of holy persons,
should declare by some manifest sign, to which of them he
would be pleased to commit the holy body 01 the Saint
And in the morning, a certam elder, looking towards the
place where the body was, spoke with a loud voice, saying‚
“Our prayer, brethren, hasbeen heard hythe Lord, who
“deprives no oue of his reward: Arise, and behold what
“things have been done by Christ the Mediator between
“God and man, that our dispute might be settled3 and as
“iu the life, so in the death of the holy confessor Teilo,
“miracles should be performed.” For, lo! they saw there
threebodiestowhieh there was the samedimensious 01 body,
the same beauty 01 eounteuanee, (what morel) they had
the lineamenta 01 the whole frume, without any differeuce.
