2.-LANN0USTENH1NN1 GARTHBENNI IN ERGYNG, OB
· ARCHENFIELD.

Be it known to you that King Pebiau son of Erb, grant-
ed the Manor of Garthbenni, as far us the black Marah be·
tween the wood, and field, and water, and the property of
King Cystennyn, his father-in-lew beyond the river Wye,

sch century, end was so celebrated, that scholare floclred to it from all parts
of Christendom, among whom were the sons of the Britiah nobles, and foreign
princes, besides numerous others, amounting atone time to more than two
thousand pupils. .For the accommodatiori of this large number, there were
no less then four hundred lodging apartments, and seren large halla or col·
leges. The course of instruction adopted by St. Illtyd, embraced, not only
such sacred and profane literature as was requisita for clerical educaticn, but
also included husbandry‚ end other usehrl arte. For many moratione, this
seminary continued to be the University of Britain, and to be frequented by
the most illustrious persons of all countries, till its ravenues were hanmened
to the Abbey of Tewkesbury, by Robert Fitrhamon, when the universities
of England acquired the ascendancy, end that cf Illtyd sanir into compara-
tive obscurity.-Lewia' Topographical Dictionary of England-Williams'

¹Llangystennyn Garthbenni in Ergyng. 'I'his chmeh was in Hereford-
shire, but its situation is not known, as it has become minated, or, which
is more probable‚ has changed ita name. It was probably founded by Cys-
tennyn or Constantine, father-in-law of Pebian ab Erb. But whether
this Cystennyn can be identified as either cysseum Gomeu, a Corniah
Chieftain of the early part of the eth century, or his contemporary, Cys-
tennyn Fendigaid, who was a sainted King in Britain soon after the depan-
ture of the Romans, cannot be determined; but from the circumstance cf
the following grant of LlangerniW, or the Church of the Comishman, being
made by Pebian, it may be presumed that he aud Cystennyn Gomeu were
the same person.
