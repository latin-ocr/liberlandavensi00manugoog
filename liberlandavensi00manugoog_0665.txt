and apostolical benediction. That peace may be given to
the churches, and the rights of each be preserved, we have
appointed the next festival of st. Luke to be the term for
thee, and our venerabis brother Urban, Bishop of Llandnffi
that presenting yourselres iu our sight, the dIspute thch
it agitated between you respecting parochia] boundaries
may be settled. But afterwards he informed us by his
letters and messeugers, that thy Archdeacons had violentiy
ejected him from the possession of those parishes, respecting
which thou hest laid complaint against him. Ihat, there-
fore, an occasion may not be afforded him for extending
his lawsuit, we commend thee by this present writing, to
restore to him possession of those parishes without moles·
tration, that being constituted possessor, he may at the fixed
term be able to answer thee by judicial right-Giwen at
