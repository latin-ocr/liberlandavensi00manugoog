AngloSaxon language, ferit was the property of the
Church of Llandaff in Wales before it earne to the Church

of Liohfield‚ where it is now preserved, inscribed Tria
Tnx‘r or ST. Graan, the Patron of that Church.
“And of these Annotations I have received Explana
tions1 in letters sent to me by the very learned and skilfirl
cultivator of British Antiquities, Mr. Edward Lhuyd‚ the

very worthy keeper of the Ashmolean Museum in the
University of Oxford, &c * * * *

“Thus far with respect to the Annotations written by
Welshmen in this Book, which is venerable on account of
its antiquity3 the first of which by Gelhi, who gave it to
the Church of Llandaff, is written in nearly the same hand
as the Book in the Bodleian Library, which is marked
NE. D. II. 19, and therefore I think it may be adjudged
to the commencement of the ninth century. Those that
follow seem to be not much more modern, not only on

account of their antiquity‚ but because it is manifest from
another MS. Book⁹ of the said Church of Llandaff, that

Libiau, the fourth Bishop of Llandaff from Nywys, men-
tioned in these Annotations, died in the year 929?

“mention, is the Ilandaff Gospel, called St. Chad’s Book, at Lichlield,
“which pooeibly may be eleven hundred years standing. It hes besides
‘⁸ some later Saxon, a few ancient memoriale of donatione ιο the Church of
‘⁴ Llnndsff entered here and there in the margin, which are partly Latin
“ and partly British, and are about nine hundred years standing, but have
‘⁴ been lately mangled by the bookbinder.'’ See also peges 4 and 5 of the
same work-And in a letter to Humphrey Wanley, dated Feb. 8, 1703,
he says, “I never saw any Welsh writing near so old as that you sent me
‘⁴ out of the lichfield MS. excepting three verses I lately sent ιο the Bishop
‘⁴ of Hereford [Humphrey,] who is so curious in our Language and antiqui· ,
“ties, that I am sure he would bs very glad ιο see the Lichfield MS.”-
