1.-οΕ THE FIRS'I' STATE OF THE CHURCH ΟΕ LLANDAFF.

In the year of our Lord, 156, Lucius,2 King of the Bri· '
tons, sent his ambassadors, Elfan and Medwy, to Eleu-

¹Ths arrangement of tho original Text of the Book is hereby somewhat
change& the information relating to Urban, Biahop of Ilandaff, tho last
Biahop mentioned therein, being removed to tho latter part, and eonstitu-=
ling the laet three chapters of tho English translation. The snbjeot matter
of this second chapter commences in tho Latin at the etth page.

²authors are by no means agreed about tho time of the eonversion of
lling Lucius. Archbishop Ushsr cites no less than three aad twenty differ-
ent opinions3 Beda, theold Saxon Annals, and the author of the Annals oi
tho Chureh of Rochester, who flourlshed about the year 1224, lix on the
year 167, in tha oonsulship of Severus and Herennianus, and in tho eleronth
year of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, when Eleutherius was Bishop of
Rom03 bnt Ushsr dates it nine years later. Notwithstanding this differ·
enos oi ohronnhgy, that there was snoh a Christian King as Lucius about
that tinne is beyond question3 for Nennins, who lived in the begin·
ning of the seventh century is positive on this point, and the English am-
bmsdors at the oonnoil of constance pleaded Lucins’s conversion against
tho amhaasador of Castile as an argument for precedente. However, it is
erident from Gildas, and other writers, that Christianity got footing here in
the apostolical age, bnt what progress it made, in what parts the chureh
was established, and under whom, what snoeeases or disoonragementa,
what revolutione happened in the Ecclesiastlcal History of this island from
the tirno of tho Apostles to King Lucius, is altogether uncertain-Collier’s
Ecclesiastical History, Vol. Ι. p. 12.
