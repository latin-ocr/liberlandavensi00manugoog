The complaint of your mother, the Ghuroh of Llnndsffi
hos oome to us, because it is plundered of its property hy
you, and reduosd to almost nothing. Wherefore we, oon·
doling with due affeotion have sent these letters to you,

deloythelands‚ tithes, oblatione, sepultores, and other pro-
perty, which you have wiekedly taken away and detained

assist your said mother, ye shall obtain the ierom of Al·

our venerable brother Urbem, your Bishop, has with eanoni-
oal justice promulgated.-Given ot Soissons, Oot. 16, 1119.
