festival of St. Lulre he should come to the apostolical See
to answer thee respecting tha diocesan boundaries. But
aa he, by means of letters and messengers‚ signified that
he was weighed down by sickness, old age, arrd poverty‚
and asserted that therefore he was not able to come at the
appointed time, we have had compassion on him, and, with
the advice of our brethren, have granted him an indulgence
for not coming to Rome for three years from this midlent.
Therefore, in the aforesaid term thou shalt corne before our
presence, prepared to answer respectio g Llandeilo Fawr and
