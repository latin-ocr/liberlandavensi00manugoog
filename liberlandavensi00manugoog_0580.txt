1-111111101 RHYDDERCH SON OF raerrvr

Rhydderch son of Iestyn, King of Glamorgan, indeed of
111 Wales, except the isle of Ε1ο111,1 which Iago 11111Ι
ldwsl kept 1ο1111111111; this Rhydderch, 1 say, was a pacilio
and mild man, who granted to both the elergy and laity
of his whole kingdom, and to the widows and orphans,
their rights aad inheritance hy both divine and human
lew, and especially to the chureh of God, and 111 gover-
nors, thetis Bishops, end 111 persons 11 inferior orders; in
whose time there was no desolation throughout all Weles,
either 011 the 1111111111 11 the plain, except in three
vilingen, which were in a solitary situation. To Llandaff
indeed, and its 111111, Dubricius, Teilo, and Oudoceus, and

111 the year 1046. The <iate given in the biyvyrian Archaiology 11
J oseph’s death is 10433 he is there represented as having been very eminent
for piety and learning, and to have restored the manner 11 celebrating
Sainte’ days to 111 original purpose of prayer 11111 almsgiving3 also, he ia
said to have, in the year 1030, prevented any secnlar work being puraued
on the Sabbath and Holidays, and tc have compelled his clergy not to inter·
fere in any quaneh, bnt to read and leam the Scriptum, without 111 11
reward.

’Profeoeor Rees, in his “Welsh Saints,” p. 249, observes respecting thia
grant, “ 11111 if it ever took place, it was only 111 the short reign of Rhy-
dderch ab Iestyn3 1111111 Dimetian princes, considering him to be an
1111111, took 11 arms against him, and a battle ensued, in which he was
alain, leaving his Principaiity to he divided between the conquerere. Sub-
sequent events prove that they did not confirm his benefactions3 and his
reason 111 bestowing those poasessions upon the aee 11 1111111111, it gronnded
npon the supposition that they once belonged to Teilo, must have rested
1111 asaiae foundation, for that Prelate was alac the acknowledgcd Arch-
hishop of Menevia.’'

³ Probably the lale 11 Anglesey is herc intended.
