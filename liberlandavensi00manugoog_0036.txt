VI.·-1. The ancient MS. copy of the Lrsns Larvns-
vnssrs, which belonged to the Bishops of Llandaff, having
come into the possession of Mr. John Selden, as before
mentioned, the imitation copy supplied its place, for the
next particulars met with by the Editor relating to the
MS. in the Church of Llandaff, is in Lhuyd’s “Archaeo-

, ‘⁴ logia Britannica,” published, as before stated, in 1709,

p. 259, where it is mentioned that the Archives of Llan-

, daff contain a very neat copy on parchment, lately tran-
. scribed, in which the handwriting of the ancient book was

preserved, but more elegantly than accurately written.
From which it appears that the ancient MS. was not then
at Llandaff, and it may be concluded that the neat copy
· written in similar characters, was obtained to supply its
plaoe; and being a good imitation of the ancient mode of

writing used in the old MS. was by subsequent authors
behaved to be such ancient MS. itself

2. In the “Survey of the Cathedral Church of Llandaff,” ·
by Browne Willis, Esq. published in 1718, aforesaid, he
mentions that there were three books in the custody of the

Chapter of Llandaff, one whereof, he was told, was theold
Register Book, or Lrsas Lanosvsrvsrs, referred to in the
Monastioon, called Tilo, said to be compiled by Bishop
Urban, as before mentioned. From which it appears
that he was informed that the MS. or rather transcript of
the Register was then at Llandaff, although he mistakes
in saying that it was compiled by Bishop Urban, as the
compilor was the Bishop’s brother, Galfrid.

3. In the “Antiquities of Lantwit Major,” by the Rev.
David Nicholl, (1729) before mentioned, the Lrsns LAN-
navsrvsls is referred to, and called a very valuable manu-
script, which was above six hundred years old. The MS.

and that, though it resembled Mjss Elstob’s famous copy from the Textm
Roffensis, (a srmilar MS.) it was s greater rask, being s ve large volume.
-Thc account of the chgwrt Library, given in Csrts’s MSS. de osited in
the Bodleian Library at Oxford, is as sollo “ Bibliotheca Vpschiana-
κ165 paramenta, and other books, among whwiMr is the Liber landavensis,
“copied from Mr. Scldon's Library.”
