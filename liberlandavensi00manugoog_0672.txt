daries of the diocese, might be determined, and that the
church might for the future have rest, we appointed to thee

the festival of St. Luke to be the term whereiu thou should· ’

est come to our presence, and answer respecting his com·
plaints. And our aforesaid brother Bishop Bemard, attend-
ed bya large company of clergy and laity‚ offered himself to
our sight in the said term, being proposed to proceed. But
three persons, delegated on thy part, declared on oath, and
by touehing of the holy gospels‚ that being detained by ill-
ness‚ thou wast not able to come. We, therefore, providing
for the want and labour of both churches, have committed
this business to be carried on in England,by curvenerable
brothers William, Archbishop of Cauterbury, Thurstan,
Arcbbishop of Yorlr, and H. Archbishop of Rouen. And
it pleases us, if it can be accomplished, that peace and
concord be restored between thee and Bishop Bernard
through their advice and deliberation. We, therefore,
strictly command thee, that settiug all business aside, and
without making an appeal, thou dost present thyself to the
said brothers on the next Sunday, on which is read, “I am
the good Shepherd‚” with the letters, and charter of our
predecessor, of happy memory‚ Pope Honorius, and other
· instruments, and the surviving witnesses which thou hast
produced before him; that they may hear thy statements,
and those of our said brother Bishop Bemard, and more
fully understand them, and intimate to us what they may
have investigated. But shouldest thou have course to sub-
terfuge, and contemptuously decline to present thyself,
and to act, thou must take care that thou dost not sustain
injury by thy absence, and we appoint him the possessor,
and thee the petitioner.—Given at Troyes the 2lst day of
December, [1131.]
