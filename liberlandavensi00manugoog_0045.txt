xxxviii Phaeaca.

duced, as the Editor conceived would render the Work
more intelligible and interesting to the general reader.
Of these, however, the principal one is the transposing

⁹ of the documents relating to the time of Urban, the last

Bishop of Llandaff mentioned in the Work, from the for·
mer portion, where they were placed, to constitute three
Chapters in the latter part, after the particulare related
of the other Bishops who preceded him in the See.l Be-
sides this alteration there is no change in the arrangement
of the articles, although they might be more chronologi-
cally placed; and they are left to remain as originally
arranged, that reference to them may be the more easily
made from one of the languages to the other. The
Translation is likewise divided into Chapters, with the
contenta of each placed at its commencement; the Sec·
tions are numbered, and new heading titles given to such
as were without them3 the longer paragraphs are dirided
into smaller ones, and explanatory running titles given
at the top of the page, for the information and conveni-
ence ol the reader. With respect to the 'lhanslation it·
self, the Editor has to observa, that one of the professed
objects of the Society, being to publish English Thansla·
tions, as well as the original MSS. and many persons hav-

he has given a Translation of the whole Work. He like-
wise thinks proper to mention, that his aim in executing
it, was, to give as close a rendering as possible of the ori·
ginal Latin in the Enghsh language. However, aa the
sentences of the writers of the age were frequently incon-
veniently long, he has sometimes divided them into shorter

place in the tima of Biaho Ur occurred at a eriod later than those
recorded at the end of anchis. B' o Godwin concluded that the account
did npt extend to later than 1110, and Euan Erana, ae mentioned in lewis
Morrra’ MSS. no later than 1104, the time of the death of Bishop Herwald,
whereas it extended to 1132, nearly the death of Bishop Urhan, as appears
in the arrangement of the articles in the English lhanalation.
