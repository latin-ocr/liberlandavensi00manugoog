and 1110 stags, no one driving them, followed. And 11101
their praying might not be any more internupted by busi-
ness of the kind, the same wild animale, 101 0 long time
after, hythe direction of God, brought wood to them, and

what things were necessary for the use of the holy men χ

Who therefore doubts thet those persons were holy, to whom
God caused the stags thus to minister? Others may in·
deed kill the wild animale, bnt they cannot so tame them

When they approached their residence, all 1110 inhabitants ἵ

01 11ιο place met them, and said, “O divine brethren, how

.“manifestly hove ys been distinguished this day by divine
“ grace, for the irrational bmtes have become your ser-
’ “ vante. We, therefore, are unhappy persons, who have
“not oheyed the saints until we 010 admonished by brute
“animals to obey them.” In the meantime, St. David
going out of his tent, found before the door thereos, 0
book open, which had been ignorantly left by the brethren,
and although it rained vehemently, it was altogether un·
injured by the 1010. Which he admiring, said, “God
“is wonderful among his sainte, and holy in his worlrs”
And that 0 good thing might not be stilled in oblivion, but
widely spread abroad, he immediately called ‚the elders of
the people, that beholding the wonderful works of God,
they might render prayens and vows to the Lord, and pnb-
lisb to men the sanctity 01 their brethren, because God bad
preserved their book from the rain.

Tbat those persons might be more and more distinguish-
ed by miracles‚ through the faith 01 Christ, as God caused
water to flow from the rock for the tbirsty israelites, so
be ordered fresh fountains to arise for the thirsty saints;
and as we have heard from old inhabitants 01 the place,

they who drank 01 those fonntains, asserted that they did
not drink water, but wine, so pleasant was its taste.
