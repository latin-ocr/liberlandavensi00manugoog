in the Church 01 Llandaff in the beginning 01 the seven·

his “Catalogue 01 the Bishops 01 Llandaffi'' and respect-
ing which he says, aa before mentioned, that the Church
01 Llandaff had a Book 01 venerable antiquity, which was
written npwards 01 five hundred years ago.

2. The mention of this copy which next occurs, is in an
article in Lincoln’s Inn Library, (No. 34,) in one 01 Sir
Matthew Hale's MSS. avolume 01 unscellaneous extracto
ou historic matters, by the celebrated Mr. John Selden.
