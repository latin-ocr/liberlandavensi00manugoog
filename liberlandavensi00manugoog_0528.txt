pecially those who dwell in the southern part of Britain,
that Gwallwn son of Ceidrich‚ being excited by anger and
rege, arose, with uplifted head, against his lord, that is to
say, Hywel son of Rhys,¹ King of Glewyssig, breaking the
peace, and would take from him by force and violence the
land of Lantivei. And the dispute and contention be-
tween the King and Princo being heard throughout the
country, Cerenhir, Bishop of Llandaffi exhorted them to
agree and make peace. And having heard his entreaty,
and obeying him, they came to Llandaff witha large
military rethma, and on the altar of St. Dubricins, St.
Teilo, and st. Oudocena the holy gospels being placed
before them, they awore that for the future there should
be peace between them, without fiand or treachery3 there
being present three Abbots, Elisael, Abbot of Oadoo;
¹ Elised, Abbot of Illtyd; -, Abbot of Docunni3 Cy-
wared, reader3 ‘Gwerngen Ruid, Esne, Pasgen; and laity
present, Mor, Merchytir, Iddgant, Embresel.

After these things, King Hywel broke his peace, and
committing both murder and perjury, killed Gwallwn trea-
cherously3 and on his being murdered, the Bishop assem·
bled a complete synod at Llandaff, there being gethered to-
gether all the clergy of the whole diocese, from the mouth
ofTaratyron Wye to the mouth of Towy; and all the crosses
being with one voice placed on the ground, and the bella
inverted, and the relics of the saints taken from the altar,
and thrown to the ground, he excommunicated the King,
taking from him all the communion of Christians3 and he
remained under that excommunication nearly a whole year.
