the time he wrote the compilation.

As Urban became Bishop 01 Llandaff in the year 1107,
and died in 1133, and the last document recorded in the
Book is considered 10 be of the date of the preceding year,
it may be reasonably inferred that the compilation of the
work was completed in the former part 01 the twelfth
century, that is in 1132; for had it 001 been concluded
until 11101 his death, such an important event would very

of England,’' has express reference to this Work, In the
first edition, published 10 the year 1601, when he was
Sub-Dean 01 Exetcr, he mentions several particulars of
the earlier Bishops of Llandaif, which seem to have been
extracted from it, but the name of the Book is not men-
tioned, nor is there any allusion made thereto. In later
editions, however, when he had become Bishop 01 11110-
daff, having succeeded to the See 10 the year in which the
former edition was published, he evidently refers to the
