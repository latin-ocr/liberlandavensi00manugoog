l.-CONCERNING ἸἮΕ LIFE OF SAIN'I' TEILO, ARCHBISHOP
OF THE CHURCH OF ausuum.

1. This holy man, dearly beloved brethren, was from his
infnncy a worshipper of God3 nor is it wonderful, for
before his infanoy‚ God had predestinated him to be his

whom he loved, and he crowned his beloved with the
victory of a true confession. The man of God therefore
carried on his warfare by being urgent in his prayers to
God, and by giving to the poor all that he possessed.

his own. For leaving nothing remaining 10 himself of his
own, he gave in exchange perishing for eternal things. Ο
how great, and what a merchant, who gave his own to
God, that he might receive au hundred fold! Ο precious
