Ia-BULL OF POPE HONORIUS II. ΤΟ WILLIAM, ARCH-
BISHOP OF CANTERBURY.

Honorius, Bishop‚ servant of the servants of God, to
the venerable brother William, Archbishop of Canterbury,
Legate of the apostolic see, health and apostolical bene-
diction. We appointed to our brothton Bernard, Bishop
of St. David’s, and Richard, Bishop of Hereford, Midlent
to beatem, that they should corne to our presence, and
if they considered that they hed anything against Urban
Bishop of Llandsff, with respect to the districts, concern-
ing which a dispute had arisen among them, they should
obtain what justice should dictate3 but they neither cume
nor sent persons who should act for thern. We, therefore,
with the communicated advice of our brethren the Bishops,
took the oaths of the witnesses, which our brother Urban
had produced, who, with touching the holy gospels affirm-
ed that those five districts, namely, Gower, Kidwellygcan-
trebychan‚ Ystradyw, and Ergyng, were contained within
the limits of the diocese of Llandaff, thetis, between the
rivers Wye and Towy, and they hed seen Bishop Herwald,
the predecessores Urbon, for forty years possessing those
districts quietly, and without any canoniccl interruption.
Therefore, by canonical authority, we adjndge that he
and his successore shall have the aforesaid districts for
svers Wherefore, we commend thee, with requiring, that
thou wilt cause to be observed what is adjudged by the
holy Roman Ohurch, and that concerning the aforesaid

five districts, thou wilt suffer no injury to arise tolhime-
Given at the Lateran the 4th day of April, [1129]
