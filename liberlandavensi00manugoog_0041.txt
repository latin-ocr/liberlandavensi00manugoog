This copy is still to be met with in the said library, from
which, a transcript was kindly allowed to be taken, in the
first instance, with reference to the printing 01 this Work;
it is, however, stated to have been found, on examination,
Α in a very unsatisfactory state, having been written by some
person who was both ignorant and careless—letters and
parts of words being frequently omitted,n0t from any known
principles of abbreviation, but from obvious carelessness3
his blunders appeared in every line, so that a critical revi-
sion 01 the text for its correction was necessary to prepare
it for publication. The MS. is said to have been given
to the Collega by Dr. Jonathan Edwards, a former Prin-
cipal 01 that Society, and is supposed to have been writ-

it was not from the Register, but only from porticus of it
there deposited, that the said extracts were made—As to

the MS. copy ol the L1aua Lannnvansrs in the posses-
