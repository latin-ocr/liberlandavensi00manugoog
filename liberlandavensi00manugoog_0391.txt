Sunday, the aad day of May, he was received into his
church of Llaudaffi when there was a processioa, and the
holy crosa with abundance of relics, was carried3 and on
whose arrival there was plenty of rain, which was much
wanted by the people, for it had not rained even a drop
for seven weeks and upwards throughout the district of
Glamorgan. On Wedncsday, the 2nd day of June, the
aforesaid Bishop of good memory, alter the labour under·
gone, and on account of the obtaining of so great joy
to himself and the church for having procured so great a
patron, and tasting and prayer having been made, called
together his canons, and his brother Emi, who was Dean
of the same church, and a man of chastity, and very great
prudence‚ and also his chaplain, named Isaac, a man of
great shrewdness and ability. And the sacred relico of St
Dubricius being laid on the ground, were placed together
that they might· be prepared, the duat separated, and be
washed with water asterso longa journey. Being put with
their own hands, out of reverence towards so great treasure
and the whole country, into three basona before the altar of
Peter the apostle, and the holy confessors Dubricius, Tollo,
and Oudoceus; immediately, by the touch of the holy ra-
lics, the water bubbled on all sides in a marvellous manner,

as if a great red hot stone had been thrown into it ἶ

And they did not only wonder, being amazed at the wa·
ricus ebullitione throughout the whole bason, but also be-

cause they perceived the water to be very hot. Not only ¹
for a short time, or the space of a moment, but also, os ἵ

long as they were alternately moved by them in common in

the water, so long the water increased in heat to the end ,

of the ablution; and not only the sight and touch perceired

this miracle but the hearing likewise, for the sound ol ¹

the bubbling of the heated liquid was heard.
