dignity which was confirmed 10 his posterity for ever, was
deshous to visit the places where holy persons resided and
with great devotion sought the residence 01 St. David, on
account 01 his veneration for him, and the daily mention
01 him in his prayers3 and aa he wished 10 take with him
holy relies, he took them, and carried them with him with
great veneration3 and he also took with him from his
place 01 residence at Llandeilo fawr, some of the relies of
the disciples 01 his maternal uncle, St. Το110, and placed
them together in 0 ohest convenient for the purpose.

ΙΙ. And 00 he travelled through his diocese, towards
his Church at Llandaff, his attendants reverently carrying
the relies, and singing psalma with praises, and the holy
cross going before, when they cameto the road 01 Penn-
allt in (lydweli,l there came some persona from the rocks
01 Pennallt, who had ill will against the holy man, and
said, “Shall those olergy, who are loaded with gold and
“silver‚ and ae we may say, with the treasures 01 St. David,
“and St. Teilo, escape from our hands? No, let them be
“takenz and having got all their wealth from them, we
“‘ shall be enriched with great weight 01 metal in gold and
“silver.” And being lull 01 envy and covetousness, they
attacked, with great fury, those who carried the ehest;
but when they reached forth their hands, and held their
lancesjagainst the holy man and his attendants, their eyes,
which sinned against them, lost their sight, and their arms,
which were ready to ahod the blood 01 the just person,
became stiff, 00 that they could not bend them towards
themselves, nor by any means extend them. ·

ΠΙ. St. Oudoceus beholding the privation and death 01
the offenders, began to pray to God with bended knees in

¹Kidwelly, the name 01 0 Town and Hundred in Carmnrthenshire.
