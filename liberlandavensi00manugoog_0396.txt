And he hed there for a companion St David,l a man of
most perfect life; to whom he was united by so much love,
and the grace 01 the Holy Spirit, thet in their transactione,
they both had the same thought with respect to what was
10 hedone, and what to be left undone. Behold, dearly
beloved brethren, how God unites his saints on earth,
whom he 01001010 be citizens in heaven; he chose two,
that by means 01 two hc might choose many. Ο blessed
1110 01 these two, through which the souls 01 100ογ persons
have received refreshment.

Scythia, who, from their painted clothes, or the colour of
their eyes, were called Pictr, 0001010 a very large 11001 10

00 account 01 the plenty of the good things, with which it
then, above all islends, abounded, invaded the country 01 the
Britons, more through means of treachery than force, and
for some time exercised very great tyranny orer them.
Nor is' it wonderful that it was overcome by it; for the

nation 01 the Picts were crafty, and trained in many en-
gagementsby sea andland3 and the other, although endued
with strength of body, was artless, and peaeeable, and not
ἶ having been by any one attached, and ignorant 01 war,
ξ was the more easily subjugated. If any 000 shordd be de-
} sirous 01 having a more full account, hc will find it in the
l History 01 Gildaa the Historian 01 the Britons.
