¹ Urbau is called in the Welsh Chroniclee‚ (1111100, where he 100100 10-
presented as being celebrated for his wisdom 001 liberality, 00 well es 101
1110 munificence in bestowing honourable 001011100010 upon the Cathedral 01
11001011, aud upon various Mouasteries which had been pillaged during the ·
. wars 01 Iestyn son of Gwrgau and Robert Fitz Hammon. It is also 010101
that he was 00 active aad vigorous suppremr 01 0110111 and viciens prac-
tices and customs, and was 0 01001 conciliatory arbitrator in all contentione,
1110 effect of which wne, that his diocese became more peaeeable thau any
other part of Wales. -Myu Aroh. II. 116.

The three following Chapters 01 this Work bear ample testim0uy 01 the
indefatigable real of Bishop Urbau,' m his strenuous efforts 10 1001010 the
Dioeese 01 Llandaff to ite original state. Although unable to retain
possessiones those territories in the dioeceses 01 St. Darid’s and Hereford,
which he considered to 11010 belonged to Llaudaff, he appears to have been
successful iu raising to 0 01010 01 prosperity the 10100000 01 his see from the
poor and miserable condition to which, through the negligeuce aud inability
011110 predecessore, they had been reduced. By these means, with the aid 01
other 1000111000, he was enabled 10 rebuild the Cathedral 01 Llaudaff, which
had become almost a heap of ruins during the dissstrous 11010 101110000-
quest 01 Glamorgau by the Normans. It isuncertain what might 11010 been
the issue 01 1110 disputo respecting the territorias 01 the diocese, had Urbau
lived to see its conclusion, which, however, was 1101 permitted him, as he
was cut off by death when travelling “beyond the seas,'’ in his fourth
jourucy 10 Rome, in the 17111 year 011110 030001 in the year 1133.
