580 uranu, arsnor. Cnsr. XII.

year to the clemency of the apostolic sce, didst assert
that thou hadst laid a complaint against Bemard, Bisbop
of St. David’s, and Richard,1 Bishop of Hereford, in the
presence of brothers William, Archbishop of Oanterbmy,
Legate of the apostolic see, and the Bishops of England,
with respect to part of thy diocese being retained by them3
but because thou didst consider that an injury had been
inflicted on thee, thou didst invite them to come to our
presence, and answer to thy complaints on the then next
midlent; but at the aforesaid term they neither came nor
sent persons to answer for them. Wherefore, the advice
of our bretbreu being communicated, on receiving the tes-
timony of two witnesses, we have invested thee with the
portion of the diocese whereof complaint was made, bnt
saving the right of the churehes of St. David's and He-
reford.

And we appointed a term, and fixed to them the next,
then future, midlent, that the truth being more fully
known and discussed, we might render justice to each
person. But they neither came in that term, nor sent
persons who should conduct their cause in our presence;
thou, however, brother Urban, in the appointed term,
didst present thyself in our sight ready with witnesses; and
we, having for some time waited for those who were invi-
ted, took the oaths of six witnesses, two of whom, that is,
a certain intelligent priest, and a layman, swore that thy
portion, respecting which the lawsuit had been instituted,
that is, Gower, Kidwelly, Cantrebychan, Ystradyw, and
Ergyng, was contained within the bounds of the diocese

¹ It is mentioned in Godwin do Presulibus, p. 482, that Ricbmd, Bishop
cf Hereford, died August 15, 1127, whereas his name appears in this and
other documenta, dated in the year 1129.
