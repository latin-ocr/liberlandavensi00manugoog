ιο reason. As our brother Urban, Bishop of Llandaff,
complains against thee because thou dost permit some of

· his parishoners of Archeniield to communicate in the

ohurch of Hereford, against whom he hod pronounced
sentence of excommunication3 and dost endeavour to
ordain Bishop, a Prior1 of his, belonging ιο his esta
blishment, who impudently aspires, aethe said Bishop
asserta, ιο the Bishopric of Hereford, and communicatos
in the same church as those whom he has excommunicated.
Therefore, we command thee by the present writings, thet
thou inflict on him no injuryormolestation, nor communi-
cate with his parishioners who have been excommunicated

by him, nor promote his elergyman without his consent.—

ra-nplsnnn OF JOHN, CAItDINAL, ΤΟ URBAN, BISHOP
OF LLAIIDAFF.

To his brother Urban, the venerable BIshop of Llandaff,
bis brother John, Priest Cardinal of the holy Roman
Churoh, sends health and respect. Inasmuch aa our
Lord the Pope has not written anything to the King
of England respecting your case, it is because he has
not as yet obtained his complete favour, nor the mes-
senger of the Bishop of St. David's spoken to our Lord
the Pope, nor made any mention either of him or his
cause. Goon weil. Our advice is that you remain
in your diocese, and do not corneto us at present, until,

you shall hear something more certain respecting our
Lord the Pope, and the King. [uso]
