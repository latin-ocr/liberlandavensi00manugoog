Tan Lrnnn Lawnavnusrs, or Tac Boon or Lnawnarr,
is so called because it is the ancient Chartulary, or Regis·
ter Book of the Cathedral of Llandaff, wherein were re-
corded Memoirs of its more eminent Prelates, Grants 01
Endowmem, and other interesting and important particu-
lars relating to the Church and Diocese. It has also been
called Lnrrn Tarm, or Tun Boon or 111110, because the
Diooese sometimes went by the name of Teilo, St. Teilo
. being one of the most eminent 01 its Prelates, and also
because part of the materiola, whereof it was compiled,
was contained in a still more ancient Register, that went
by his name, to which it makes reference,1 and which it
probably superseded.

The compiler 01 the Work is stated to have been Gal-

frid² or J effrey‚ brother 01 Urban, the last Bishop 01 Llan·

deff mentioned therein‚ whose undertaking appears to be
to make the older Register of Teilo his ground-work, and
to give in addition such other suitable information aa he
could obtain, and think proper to communicate, and to
relate the particulare according to the mode of description
