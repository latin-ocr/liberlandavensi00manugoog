Sucr. 1. mnu os ar. ramo. 341

“thou art exalted above thy follow-brethren, for thou hast
“satin the seat 01 our Lord Jesus Christ, in which he
“preached the kingdom 01 God to our fathers.'’

The holy man on hearing this, arose with great astonish-
ment, and prostrating himself on the ground, said, “Bles-
“sed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel 01
“the ungodly‚ nor stood in the way 01 sinnas, and hath
“not sat in the seat of the scomful.”1 “And blessed be
“the Saviour, who chose that a seat for him should be
“made of wood, who, through means of wood should suo·
“cour a perishing world.'’ So being humble, he humbly
adored the seat, yea him, who had sat therein, because he
being a creature, considered it to be the seat of the Creator.
Wherefore it happened that they requested that he would,
forinstruotingthem in virtue, speak to them aword concam-
ing Christ3 and as he had imitated him in sitting in the
ohnir, he would imitate him in preaching. Observingthem
to be warmed with divine love, St. Teilo was perplexed in
a surprising manner, not because he did not know what to
100011, but he doubted with respect to what they requested,
aud what was suitable for them, since he was altogether

, ignorant of their language. Yet the holy man, that he

might satisfy the supplicating paople, began to explain the
Scriptums, so that every one 01 them who stood around,

l heard him speak in his own language.

And all who heard him preaching, were so pleased with
the sweetness 01 his discourse, that the longer they heard,
the more they were desirous 01 hearing him. At length,

¹ aiter they were all refreshed by his salutary doctrine, lest

it should seem that he was presumptuous in executing the
' office 01 preaohing‚ if he alone preaohed‚ he said to the

¹ Psalmi. 1.
