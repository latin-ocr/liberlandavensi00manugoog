ference to those of Llandaffi¹ thereis in the account of
them no where greater obscurity‚ no where more diffi-
culties, and which appear to have been occasioned by
. our Author not clearly understanding his subject, and
compiling the Work without a careful examinationes the

nature of his materiale. To remove, therefore, the ob-
scurity and difficulties, with which the subject has been
evidently encompassed for ages, and the doubts of authen-
ticity they have occasioned, and to render the Work moro
intelhgible and satisfactory, it has been thought proper to
give a Chronolog'cal Series of the Bishops of Llandaff at
the end of the Volume‚2 wherein an endeavour is made, by
reference to the Kings of the districts, and the Witnesses
mentioned in the Grants given in their respective eras, to
fix the true order of the succession of the Bishops end the
time when they respectively lived. It will be observed
that the succession inferred from the order of the docu-
ments in this Work, and adopted for the most part by
Godwin, Leland, Enderby‚ Heylin, Le Neve, Browne
Willis, and others, who have given lists of the Bishops of
Llandaff, is herein in some respects considerably altered,
and a chronological List given of them different from
what has been before published. In this list it will be
seen that several of the earlier Bishops, who were deemed
to have independently enjoyed the See of Llandaff, were
only suffragan or local Bishops, stationed in different dis-
tricts of the diocese under Archbishope Dubricius and
Teilo‚ and of course contemporary with them, aad with
each other. In Dugdale‘s “Monasticon Anglicanum,'’ last
edition, Vol. VI. p. 1217, it is mentioned that there was
much uncertainty in the History of Llandaff, as well with
respect to what related to the See, as to its Bishops, till

of the cathedral of hhndaff,’' .41.

² The insertion of a continued Series of the Bishops is in accordanee with
the addition to the Liber landavensis in tha Llannerch MS. which contain-
ed a Register of the Bishopa of Llandaff from Urban to the sixtoenth oen-

tury.
