9. Oollier, in his “ Ecclesiastical History of Great Bri·
tain,’' published in 1708, has several references to this
Work‚ and gives a quotation extracted from it by Dug-
dalo in his Monasticon, respecting King Lucius sending
Elvanus aud Medwinus, to Eleutherius‚ Bishop of Rome,
to desire that he might be mado a Christian by his in-
struction. And ho also says, “The old Register of Llan-
“daff, after the mention of frequent messages dispatched
“by the Britons to the Bishops of Gaul, to sssist them
“against the Pelagians, and that Gennanus and Lupus
“came over at their request‚ adds, that they consecrated
“ Bishops in many places, and made Dubrioius Archbishop
“over all the Britons of the right hand part of Britain.’'
He again states that the old Register of Llandaff, com-
monly called Tun [arnan stnavnwsm, contained several
censuros upon Princes3 and also mentions the said Work
by the same name, and says that it reported Samson to be
descended from a royal family, that his father’s name was

Llandaff3 witha reference to the second volume of Spel-
man’s ‘⁶ Concilia,” and to a MS copy of the LIBER LAN-
nnvnrvffls in the possession of the Bishop of Norwich.

10. Bishop Nicholson, in his “English Historical Li-
brary,” published iu 1714, refers to this Work‚ and says
that the Life of St. Teilo, or Eliud, St. David's successor
in his Archbishoprick, was penned by Geffrey‚ of Llandaff,
brother to Urban, Bishop of that See, about the beginning
of the twelfth century, whose trectise was still to be had
at length in an old Register Book of that Church. And
he also mentions that Bishop Godwin assuras us that all
he says of the Archbishops and Bishops of Llandaff, down
as far as 1110, was taken out of an old manuscript Regis-
ter of that Church, which seemed to him to have been

penned about that time. This he took to be the very
same as that in Sir John Cotton's library, which, on ac-
count of its giving a very particular account of the acts
