morgan, were Sovereigns of South Walcs they probably
through their influence in some measure obtained posses-
sion, and subsequently, when the Glamorgan Princes were
no longer the Sovereigns of the whole district, the Dio-
cese of blandaff may have been deprived of what had been
allowed to belong to it, and perhaps was possessed for a
short time by its Bishops and the circumstance caused
Bishop Urhan to prefer his complaints against the Bishop
of St. David’s to the Papal See in the following century.
And as the [11111111 hannavansrs was compiled by Galfrid
the brother of Bishop Urhan, who greatly exerted himself
to restore the Diocese of Llandaff to what he deemed its
true boundaries, and recover what he thought it had been
unjustly deprived of, it may be presumed that the compiler
of the Work, which, if not written in direct support of his
brother’s claims, was in accordance therewith, would adduce
every document he could to substantiate them, without
making minute euquiry into its authenticity. He appears
likewise to have written his Work with considerable bias
and partialityin favour of the See, and of the district, which
may be ohserved by his calling St. Dubricius Archhishop
of Llandalf, when anrleon was the Archiepiscopal See,
and he was only Bishop of Llandaff3 and his giving the
same title to St. Teilo, when the Diocese of Llaudaff was
only part of his jurisdiction; and also his calling Rhy-
dderch ab Iestyn King of Glamorgan Sovereign of all
Wales except Anglesey, when he had only obtained the
govemment of South Wales3 to which many other in-
stauoes might be added, and therefore some ‹aution may be
advisahle iu giving credence to every particular related in
favour of the extent of the ancient Diocese of Llandaff.
However, with attending to these remarks, aud making
au allowance accordingly, probably the historical particu-
lars herein recorded, will be found considerahly more
worthy of credit than they may appear on a cursory and
inattentive perusal. What has been advanccd on the
