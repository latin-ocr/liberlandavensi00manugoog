Taking with him Judual, he went to Lesia¹ and Angla,¹
and there collected an army, and returned with it to Brit-
tany3 St. Samson praying and fasting, and Judual fighting
with the army against Commotus; J udunl, by the prayers
of the holy man, at one blow overcame bis enemy, and
from that time, he and the successore of his family, held
the govemment of Brittany. Soon aster, J udual was tri-
umphantly received by his countrymen, and elected Gover·
nor over all Brittany3 and he rendered himself, and all who
belonged to him, subject to St. Samson and devoutly com-
mended himself to his prayers. “Iret the Govemor return
“thanks to the Redeemer, and the pcople rejoice, being
“committed to the care of such aPastor.’' Whence the
goverument of all Brittany is observed to belong justly to
Dol until this day. For what great miracles the Lord, on
this side the sea, and beyond it, has by him performed,
how much his learning abone, the eloquence of no writer,
or doctor doth relate.

Being perfect in life, and in age, and adorned with all vir·
tues, be was attacked by severe illness in the monastery of
Del, and the elergy llocking around, he gave his body to
the earth, and his soul to heaven. The clergy buried his
body with unguente, and in their hearing, the heavenly host
with hymns and praises conveyed his soul to Christ. Aproof
of his blessedness we have, namely, in those miracles which
the Lord daily performs by him to the praise and glory of
his name, who with God the Father, and Holy Spirit, lives
and reigns throughout infinite ages of ages. Amen.
