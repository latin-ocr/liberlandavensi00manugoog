2 “a very neat copy on parchment lately transcribed hut
ξ “more elegantly than accurately written, the hendwriting

“of the ancient Book being preserved. And there is
“another copy in the library of Jesus College, Oxford.
“The Work contains some Oharters of the Church of

l “Llandaffi written iu the Welsh Language‚ which are

“understood but by few on account of their antiquity.”²
And he again mentions thot there was in the Lmns unn-
nsvnwms a short account of some Privileges of the Church
of Llandaffi the beginning of which he gives, as well as
some particulare, in the ancient Welsh, with an explana-
tion in the modern mode of writing the language.
