of this place was always subject and obedient in all things
to the same Arohbishop, ond also to the King of England.
But very lately, during the reign of William Rufus, a great
number of the olergy were destroyed, and of the twenty
four canons, whereby the ohureh had been protected, bnt
two remained therein, and in the possession of the Church
only four ploughlands, and four oxgangs of land. And the
churchis not only desolate, and impoverished by haring its
territorias taken from it, but also by being deprived of its
tithes, and of the clergy of the diocese, both by the rob-.
bery of the laity and of the monks and by the great
invasion of the territory and diocese by our brethren the
Bishops of Hereford and of St. David’s. Now, I beseech
you as a father, and as an unarmedperson one who is
armed, and as a weak individual one that is strong, that
you will, as far as you are able, succour our ohureh, which
is committed to yon3 that he who made us may support

you, and aiter the end of your labour, lead you to eternal
happiness. Amen.
