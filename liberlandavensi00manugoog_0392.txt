Sacr. 1. mua or ετ. omarcms. 331

ΙΧ. Thosc things having been seen, heard, and felt, as .
the “Lord is wonderful among his saints‚” the Bishop
took a bone of the arm, and handling it, for great joy put
it into the water, and when it was at the bottom of the
water, it moved itself there for the space of more than an
hour, no one moving it but the power of God. Which
he alone having at first seen, he called the Dean to him,
who was near, that hc might see the moving of the bone,
and water, andalao the Chaplain3 as every testimony should
be in the mouth of two or three witnesses3 and they re-
turned thanks to God for so great a miracle. Which being
seen, the relies of St. Dubricius were, for the praise and
exaltaticn of the ohurch of God, placed in a tomb mutable
for the purpose, and in the old monastery, before the altar
of St. Mary, towards the north side.

And the aforesaid prelata, of good memory, observing
the small siae of the place, being in length 28 feet, in
breadth 15, and height 20, and with two aisles, one on
each side, of very small siae and height, and a porch, ofa
round form, 12 feet in length and breadth, with the od-
vice of Ralph, Archbishcp of the ohuroh of Canterbury,
end all the clergy and people of the same, began to build
a greater monastery in honour of Peter the apostle, and of
the holy confessors, Dubricius, Teilo, and Oudoceus, on
Wednesday, the 14th day cf April, in the year 11203 and
having received for himself and his ohuroh letters of the
Lord Archbishop, with a blessing and pardon to all who
would give their assistance, the work was commeuccd.
