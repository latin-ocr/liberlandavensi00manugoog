ruf-Bou. OF POPIl HONORIUS 11. ADDRESSED ΤΟ HENRY l.
me OF ENGLAND.

Honorius, Bishcp, servant of the servants of God to
the venerable Henry, King cf Englaud, health and apos·
tolieal benediction We hare appointed Midlent to be a
term for our brethren Bernard, Bishop of st David's, and
Richard, Bishop of Hereford, that they should come to our
presence, end if they considered that they had anything tc
allego against Urban, Bishop of Idandaffi with respect to
the districts, concerning which a disputehad urisen between
thern, they should obtain what justice should dictate, hut
they neither came nor sent any persons who should act for
them. We therefore, with the communicated advice of our
Bishops and Cardinuls, took the ouths of the witnesses
which our brother Urban produced, who, with touching
the holy gospele affirmed that those five districts, nemely,
Gower, Kidwelly‚ Contrebychan‚ Ystredyw, a'nd Ergyng,
were contained within the bounds of the diocese of Llsn-
daffi that is, the rivers Wye and Towy, and that they had
seen Bishop Herwald, the predecessor of Urban, for forty
years holding those districts quietly, without any canonical
interruption. Wherefore, hy canonical authority, we ad-
judge that he and his successore shall have the aforesaid
distrims for ever. We therefore command thee, requir-
ing that thou wilt cause to be observed what hasbeen
adjudged hythe holy Roman Ohurrh, and that thou'wilt
permit no iujnry to be srrstained by him with respect to
the aforesaid five districts—Girsu at the Lateran the 4th
day of April, [lma]
