predecessor Wilfrid,¹ respecting diocesan bouudaries, and
he represented that it had been decided by forty eight
witnesses, that is, twenty four from thy diocese, and
twenty four from his own. And he produced before us,
and in the sight of our brethren‚ two of those twenty four,
who asserted that they had sworn this, aud others who said
that they had seen and heard the same. Accordingly, we
were very much surprized3 but that we should not be seen
to alter anything lightly, we attended carefully to what was
said by them; and that we should know the truth more
fully, we have appointed the next feast of St. Lulre, in
the year to come, to be the term, between thee and the
aforesaid Bishop Bernard. On account of these things,
we strictly command thee, that setting aside objection,
thou dost come at the aforesaid term, with the instru-
ments which thou hast had frona us, and with the reasons
that thou hast, to answer in our presence; that the truth
being fully discovered, justice might be rendered to each,
and the peace of both churches, from the Lord presiding,

might be obtained. And also, in addition, that thou
nevertheless dost come ready prepared to answer respect·
ing the village of Ewyas‚ and the territory of Talybont,
concerning which a disputa between you was formerly
debated.-Given at the Lateran the arth day of April,
