wonderful hghtness of his body in the first place after his
death, and secondly its very great weight, which caused it
to be immoveable, rendered praises to God. And a column
of fire was seen on his tomb on tho night following his
sepulture as being pleaaing to God. And immediately, by
the advice of the Bishop of Llandaff, and clergy, anoratory
was there built, and consecrated with the sprinkling oi
water, in honour of the martyr Clydawg3l and from that
time the place began to be held in veneration, on account
of the blessed martyr.

On a certain day two men came from Llannerch Glas,
who had quarrelled with each other, and said, “het us
“agree and go to Madley‚ a ohurch of St. Dubricius, and
“both swear on his altar, that having forgotten the malice
“ of envy, and united by compact, we shall be always for
“the futuro firm friends in brotherly peace.'' Who, when
they were on the road, going the proposed joumcy‚ one of
them said to the other, “Let us go to the place ol the
“Martyr‚ (that is Clydawg,) and to his sepulchre3 and
“ shortening our joumcy‚ and our desire remaining, let us
“on his tomb agree and confirm perpetual peace between
“us'’ But after the compact was confirmed, one of
them in their return, breaking the peace, and violating the
coronant, killed the other treacherously, andalao himself,
as it is said, ‘⁶ Whoever contrives to injure another, will
“first emite himself with his own weapon.'’ For im-
mediately after having committed murder, and as I might

say, also pery'ury, he stabbed himself with his own lance in
