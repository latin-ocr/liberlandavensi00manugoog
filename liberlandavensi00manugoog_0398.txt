VIII. After God had punished these impudent women

with incurable disgraoe‚ he adorned those holy persons by
another marvellons work, and worthy of being mentioned.
Fur when the blessed Teilo and Maidoo read in the
oourtyard of the monastery, not the fictions of the poete,
or the histories of the ancients, bnt the frumentatione of
the prophet J eremiah, that they might be themora warm-
ed with the love of the heavenly country3 a certain servant
oame, and said to them that wood was wanting, wherewith
the supper of the brethren was to be prepared. And this
they considered vexatione, not because they were loath to
obey the brethren, but because they eould not return
in time from the wood for proparing their supper. They
therefore went to the wood in great haste, and being very
anxious to return soon, and bring as much as would be
sufficient for the need of those who prepared the food for
several days, that afterwards they might the longer re-
main in holy reading, and in prayer. Two very tame stags
yoked together met them, and offering their neoks tobe har-
nessed by the direction of God, afforded them their service3 ,
as if they said, “God seeing your anxiety, has deprived ns of
“our wildnesa and made us tame animala, in order that we

Χ “might perform the labour whioh you have undertaken.”

Which being hamessed‚ St. Teilo and Maidoo praised the
Lord, saying‚ “Blessed bo Gor, and the Father of our
“Lord Jesus Christ, who has meroifully regarded his

i “servants labonring for the brethren‚ by making tame ani-
y “mals of the wild beasts of the woods, that they might

“sustain tho burden of our labour.''

IX. And when the holy men had loaded their vehiole,
and were returning home, they did not, as is the usual

, oustom, stimulate the loaded stags, that they might pro-

eeed the faster, but went a great way before them,
