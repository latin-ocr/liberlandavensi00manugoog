conclusive that the ancient MS. had been returned by
Mr. Selden, and was at that timeat Llcndaff.

5. The next mention 01 this MS. copy is in the first
volume 01 the ‘⁶ Monasticon Anglicanum,” by Sir William
Dugdale, published in 1655, as before mentioned, in which
a document therein given, is said to have been extraoted
from a very ancient book, which formerly belonged to the
Bishop of Llandaff, but was at that time in the possession
01 the celebrated John Selden3 and as the quotations
01 the same articles, both by Dugdale and Spelman, afore-
said, refer to the same folios of the book, from which they
extracted them, it may be inferred that they copied them
from the same MS. It should seem that Mr. Selden had
procured the MS. possibly by purchase, that had been lent
to him before, and which he was desirous to obtain on
account of the value he attached to it, and probably to
secure it from the effecte 01 the civil war that then raged,

¹ and which was perhaps the more readily parted with on

account of the sum offered for it, and a transeript in simi-
hr characters being executed, which would supply its
place, and be thought by many of equal value, if not con-
sidered to be same, as it seems was subsequently the ease.
Aa Mr. Selden died in 1654, the year before the first
volume 01 the Monasticon was published, Dugdale must
have referred to the MS. from having seen it, and copied
extracts from itin the life time of Mr. Selden, sometime
before they were published.

6. When Mr. Selden died, he left his very valuable and
curicus Library, in which was this ancient MS. to his
Execntors, Matthew Hele, John Vaughan, and Rowland
dones, Esquires, which they intended to bestow on the

l swietl' ⁰f The Iffller Temple, if a proper place were pre.
y pared to receive it, but this being neglected, they gave it

to the University 01 Oxford, and the collection, with some
few exceptione, was placed in the Bodleian Library, in the
mouth 01 September, 1659.
