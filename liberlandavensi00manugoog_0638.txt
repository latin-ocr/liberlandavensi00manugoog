informad through means of report, that contrary to your
honour and the salvation of your souls, you have rashly
dared to plunder your mother, the Ohurch of Llandaff,
and annihilata it. Wherefore, having compassion, with
paternal affection, on your adverse conduct, we, by means*
of this present writing, do order and command that ye,
without delay, restore whatsoerer in landa, tithes, obla-
tione, sepulturas, and other property, ye have nujustly
taken and retain from the said ohurch, and other churches
of the said diocese. For if sons are to be blamed who
dishonour their natmal mother, and inflict injury on her,
much more are they who molest their spiritual one, and
by violence take away her property3 and what ie infamous,
and prejudicial to the Christian name, when ye come to
the thresholds of the saints, and the dedicatione of the
chnrohes, ye blush not to rob, and inoleat, and on the
market days take away the property of those who are
coming or returning, and kill some of them in a cruel
manner. On account of these things, we command that

ye altogether desist from these crimes, and that ye humbly
obey the orders of our venerable brother, Bishop Urban.
But if ye treat them with contempt, We, God being 0111·
adviser, will confirm the canonical sentence, which he

shall promulgate against yon—Given at the Lateran the
l9th day of April, [naa] .
