V. And when a certain prinoe¹ of that impious nation
had arrived from the seaport, aud by murdering the unfor-
trmate inhabitants, and burning the houses and churches of
the saints, prooeeded aa far as the city of St. David‘s3 he
here stopped, and built himself a palace. And when he
beheld the probity of the life of St. Teilo, and St. David,
ι and of other servants of God, who lived vvith them, he not
only envied them, as it is always the custom of the wicked

to envy the good, but also because he savv them so atten-
tive to the service of God, said many reproachful things ol -
them, that he might separate them from Christ. And
as he could not effect vvhat he wished by threats, and

bad language, he endeavoured to tempt them by various
schemes, and thought that it could not be better affected
than by the blandishments of women.

VI. He therefore ordered his housekeeper to send her
female semente to the holy men, and offer themselves to
their sight, that by their immodest deportment, and their
meretricious blandishments, they might endeavour to vvith- ,
dravv the minds of the holy men from their holy purpose.
who, whilst they executed the orders of their mistress,
and counterfeited madness, became really mad, as it
is said, “He that acts in a filthy manner, deserves to be-
“oome more filthy.” Which the aforesaid persecutor, and
all his family observing, they, by the favour of the servants
of God, received the catholic faith, and vvere baptized by
them in the name of Christ. He therefore vvas blessed,
vvho persecuted the just knowingly to become just ignorant-
ly, vvho tempted holy persons so as to become holy, vvho
quarrelled with men to become reconciled to God, vvho
despised the humble so as to take delight in humility.
