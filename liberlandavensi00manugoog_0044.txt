the MS. written by Robert Vaughan Esq. of Hengwrt,
aforesaid, which was then removed to Rdg, and in the
possessiones Col. Vaughan, the proprietor also of Hen- s
gwrt, and his 1111001 descendant. Permission, aud oppor-
tunity for collation having been kindly obtained, it wss
soou discovered that the text of this MS. was in 0 much
more satisfactory state than that 01 the Jesus Collega
copy. It was also found to confirm many 01 Μ1. Black’s
suggested emendations, and authorized, in addition, several
other evident improvements; but it was not faultless, and
the Jesus Collega MS. was sometimes more accurate,
and Mr. Black's suggestions were in some cases still more
correct then either. 1110 Editor has thought proper 10
mention the variatione at the bottom 01 the page, where
the letter Ο. designates the Oxford 01 J esus College copy,
—H. the Hengwrt copy-MSS. both of the said manu-
acripte—B. Μ1. Black-and E. the Editor.

4. lhecopy having been collated, and the Hengwrt MS.
111 consequence 0f its being the most correct, made the
bada of the 10111 101 the proposed Publicetion, the Editor
observes, that iu preparing 0 fresh copy for the Press, no
alteration whatever was made in the arrangement of the
several articles, end that the whole 01 the work was writ-
ten verbatim, without auything being omitted or added,
except merely supplying the punctuation and marking the
aforesaid variation of the text in the notes at the bottom
of the page, and placing the words Lmen Lsunrvsusm
01 the top, whereas some peges of the MS. had the names
of the Bishops 10 which their subject-matter referred,
there written3 the heading titles 01 the Sections are the
acme, without the addition of any new ones where they
might be wanted3 aud the length of the paragmphs also

ξ the same as iu the Latin original.

XIII.—-l. 111 the English Translation‚ however, the
seme 011101 regard to the original arrangement of the

1 articles, eud to other minor particulare, has not been ob·
