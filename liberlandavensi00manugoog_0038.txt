110 possession. From which particulare it may be inserted,
that Mr. Edward Williams, who died about 1829, aged
above 80 years, had seen the MS. that subsequently it
became missing, and that when he afterwards asked for it,
he was told it was gone to Culgarth Parlr, for the purpose
of putting an end to his enquiries‚ for it appears from the
foregoing account, that it never was there. It may bc
further observed, that although several enquiries have

Ἴ 1000 made respecting this MS. no 1010101011οο relating to

its present existence has been obtained.

where it is mentioned that on its left cover there was,
either in brass or copper, a picture of Teilo, the Patron of

circumstance identifies it with the Llannerch copy, as
hereafter mentioned. but whether it was then 01 Llan-
nerch there is no account. This collection of MS. ex·

tracta is in the Library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford
as before mentioned.
