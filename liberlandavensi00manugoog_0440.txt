Sacr. 1. uma or 31. ounoonus. 379

V. When Einion‚ King of Glewyssig‚¹ hunted among
the rocks and woods of the river Wye, as he was aecus·
tomed to do, ho wondered greatly how and what course the
stag was taking, as it was pursued by the dogs with the
noise of horus and huntsmen through the velhes3 but
the divine preteetion preserved it throughout, until it
reached the oloak of St. Oudoeeus3 when lying‚ 111031-
ed and recovered its breath, and was safe, as oue who
had oome to a harbour after suffering shipwreok, or who
had suooeeded to joy after sorrow. The huntsmen re-
mained afar off, with the dogs, mute and stupified, and
being astonished they now with knees bent to the Lord,
regarded as a neighbour aud friend, what they had before
pursued as an enemy.

VI. 81. Oudoceus, aman full of age and disoreet ma-
turity‚ who served God on the brook Caletan, near the
river Wye, without his eloah, on whioh the stag lay, and
which prooured him safety and protection, had regard to
the gentle beust, whioh the power of God had tamed; and
King Einion and the hunters, with great astonishment,
and with bended 1111333, and hands lilted up towards
heaven, asked pardon of the Lord and 81. Oudoceus, with
great devotion, as if they had committed some crime.
First of all the King gave him quiet possession of the
stag; afterwards he gave all the territory whioh he had
gone round during the whole day, following the traolr
of the stag, to God, and to 81. Dubrioins. 81. Τ3110, and 81.
Oudoceus the Bishop, and to all the Bishops of Llandaff
for ever; the aforesaid traok over mountains, brooks‚ and
rocks, dividing for ever the territorias of the ohureh.
