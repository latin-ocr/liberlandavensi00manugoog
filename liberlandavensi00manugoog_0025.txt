“he of no manner of consequence, but only some lew un-
“digested Notes3 veryt li ttle concerning this Ohurch, but
“relating to the general hist tory of the Kingdomss’ Bishop
N roholson was likewise deceived with respect to the value
of this MS. form his Englisht Hist orical Library he says,
“There is another Book in the same [Cottonian] Library‚
“that affords a History or Chronicle of this Ohurch, [Llan-

“daffi] which seems to have escaped the notice of both
“the diligent antiquarios, [Sir Henry Spelmau aud the
‘⁴ Rev. Mr. Whartou.] It commences at Brute, and ends
“A.D.1370.’' In the Cymmrodorion catalogue of Welsh
MSS. in the British Museum, itis described as being, iu
Welsh, 38 pagos, then in Latin, 30 pages-The Book was
examined for the Welsh MSS. Society in 1839, and it was
found that the Welsh consisted of a sort of Commentary
on the Apocalypse‚ a Life of St. David, of St. Catharine,
andos St. Margaret, and the Latin Chroniclehad buta
few particulam of ancient British History. This work
had from its title misled people to consider it the LIBER
Lawnavnwsrs as it contained a good deal of Welsh, which
they, not understanding, erroneously concluded it to relate
to Llandaff. It however refers to this Work, for after giv-
ing some account of the re-huilding of the Church of Llan·
daff with the consent of the King of Glemorgau, and the
honourable endowment of it by him with various territo-
rieS, rente, and privileges, it is added, “as is fully related in
“the Book of Teilo,’' as before mentioued. The whole of
ι this Chronicle, as far as it relates to Llandaff, is inserted
in the Appendix to this Work. Besides these several
MSS. said to be ιιι the British Museunr, Mr. Willis says,

“In the Custody of the Chapter of Llandaff are, as I am
“informed, only three Books‚ one of which' rs a large pa-
“per Book, wherein their Chapteit Acts sare registered;
“this Book was began to be made in the year 1573.
“Another Book is, I arn told, the old Regimen or Lissa
“Lunnavawsrs referred to iu the Mouasticon, called Tilo‚
“said to be compiled by Bishop Urban. And the third
“ relates to some orders made by Bishop Blethin.”
