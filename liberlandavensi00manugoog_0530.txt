aa-VILLAGE OF GULIBLE.¹

During the reign of Meurig son of Ithael, King of
Glewyssig‚ Ili son of Cynflws and Gamawg met together
at the monastery of Llandaff, und in the presence of

Bishcp Oerenhir, and his olergy, confirmed their peace,
both swearing upon the altar of Peter the apostle, and of
St. Dubricius, St. Teilo, aud St. Oudoceus, the holy gos-
pels and the relics of the saints being placed before them,
that their ancient enmity was done away and forgotten.
After an interval cf sometime, he who stood with joy iu
the presence of God in the heevenly paradise, and pre-
sumptuously said, “I will fix my sentin the north, and be
“like the Most High,” and falling through the effecta of
envy and pride, drew with himself from the highest throne
to the bottomless pit, part of the unclean spirits, who
agreed with him, and part he sent into the air: and who
through artful fraud deceired our first parent Adam, who
by the word of God was created eternal and holy, and was
placed in the seat of delights, with supreme happiness and
joy, and haring lost his happy state, was with his wife
cast out of paradise destitute and sorrowfu13 he, the same
ancient enemy, the incitement to envy still remaining,
caused his offspring, the aforesaid persons, to¹ disagree,
and break the peace, so far that Ili, a member of Anti-
chriat, slew Camawg treacherously, committing at the
same time both murder and perjury.

After these things, the report of his wickedness
and impiety was heard throughout the kingdom, and
