a-TREF CARN, LAITHTY TEILO, hannem

When Aircol Lawhir, son of l'ryfirn, was king of the
region of Dyfed, and in his tum held his court at Lis-
castell, which was the metropolis of the whole region, it
happened every night when the stewards of the King
served him with meat and drink, that hythe instigation
of the devii, through excess of liquor, one of the soldiers,
or of the family of the King, was always killed. And
wheu the King observed the frequent murders, he knew
that it could not be by any means presented unless by 011111-
giving, fasting, and the prayers of holy persons. Fasting
and prayer having been made, the King commanded that
as St. Teilo then resided in his mansion at Penaly, he should
quickly come to him, that he might bless him and his court,
so that the aooustomed murder should not take place any
more therein. And after St. Teilo came to him, he blessed
him and his court, and sent two of his disciples, Llywel
aud Fidelis, that they might serve the court by distributing
meat and drink to all by measure and in sufficient quan-
tities3 and by the grace of the Holy Spirit, no murder
was committed that night, nor afterwards, in his court, as
had been usual.

The King knowing that it was by means of the prayer
of St. Teilo he was liberated from that danger, granted to
him, of his own inheritauoe, three villages, that is Tres-
carn, whose boundary is from the mountain Garthon to
the source of the hrook Brad‚ downwards to Ritec; on the
other side, from the mountain Garthon to Clauorion brook,

to Riteo. Laithty Teilo, from Oaru Baclan to Oil Mein-
