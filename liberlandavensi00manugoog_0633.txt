Therefore, we decree that it shall not be lawful for any
one rashly to disturb the aforesaid church, or take away
its possessions, or retain them when taken away, diminish
them, or weary it with vexatione proceedings, but they
shall all, with the diocesan boundaries, be preserved entire
for the bcnelicial use of thyself, and oi the clergy, and the
poor. Wherelore, ii any ecclesiastical or secular person,
being informed of this instrument of our constitution, will
raahly endeavour to act contrary thercto, and being ad·
monished two or three times, if he will not amend by
giving due satisfaction, may he be deprived of the dignity
of his power and honour, and being guilty, know that he
is liable to divine judgment with respect to the iniquity
committed, and be estranged from the most sacred body
and blood of God and our Redeemer the Lord J esus Christ,
and in the last judgment be subject to severe punishment.
But may all who preserve what is j t to the said church,
enjoy the peace of our Lord J esus Christ, so that they may
herc reap the fruit of their good conduct, and from the
righteous J udge receive the reward of eternal peace. Amen.
