Innocent, Bishop, serrant of the servants of God to all
his venerahle brothton, Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Ba·
rous, the Clergyand Laity‚ the faithful of God, resident
throughout the kingdom of England, heolth and apostolical
henediction. It pleased him, who from etemity disposeth
all things, to call me, though au unworthy and unprofitoble
servant, to the govemment of the· Holy Roman Church‚
through the electiori of our brothers, William of Praeneste,
Matthew of Alba„ John of Hostes, Conrado Sabine, and
the catholic Bishops aud Oardinals. And as I considered
myself unequal, and not sufficient for so glorious an office,
I refused as far as I was able3 hut obedience being en-
joined meon the partos God, and the church, and our bro-
thers, and trusting in the support of divine mace, I obeyed.
Afterwards Peter of Leon,l through the power of his pa·
rents and brethren, and other laity, assumed the red cap,
which he had intended some time back, and through the

⁸ dilapidation of the ecclesiastical affairs, and the effusion of
blood, attempted to occupy the mother Roman Church.

Let therefore no one seduce you by frivolous and deceitful Ι
· words3 no one separate your firmness from the unity of the

Church3 for in the end of the world Antichrist strives to

injure the Church with severe oppressione. Although the

¹ Gregory, cardinal of St. AngeIo, was by the name of Innocent 11.
elected Pope, Feb. 14, 1130, the day on which Pope Honorius 11. died.

² On the day of the election of Innocent II. Cardincl Peter of Leon, for·
merly a Mouk of the Abhey of Cluny, caused himself to be chosen Pope by

another pperItpdof Cardinals,- by the nume of Anncletus, hut ultimately Inno-
cen suco .
